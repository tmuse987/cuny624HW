#### a) You can read the data into R with the following script:

```{r,echo = TRUE}
retaildata <- readxl::read_excel("retail.xlsx", skip=1)
```

The second argument (skip=1) is required because the Excel sheet has two header rows.

### b) Select one of the time series as follows (but replace the column name with your own chosen column):

```{r,echo = TRUE}
myts <- ts(retaildata[,"A3349873A"],frequency=12, start=c(1982,4))
head(myts)
```

### c) Explore your chosen retail time series using the following functions:

autoplot(), ggseasonplot(), ggsubseriesplot(), gglagplot(), ggAcf()

Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend? What do you learn about the series?

```{r,echo = TRUE}
autoplot(myts) +
  ggtitle("Monthly retail data: Australia") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Thousands")
```
                                  
                                   
Time series plot reveals following features:

1) There is continuous increment for business in retail sector data from 1982 to2012.

2) Sudden dip was observed in year 2000 and  2010 may be due to resession and slowdown of market.

3) Retail market shows dips for start of year and gradual highs towards end of it.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
ggseasonplot(myts, year.labels=TRUE, year.labels.left=TRUE) +
  ylab("$ million") +
  ggtitle("Seasonal plot: Retail data")
```
                                  
A seasonal plot allows the underlaying pattern to be seen more clearly and are useful in identifying years in which the pattern changes.
In our case, above plot makes it clear that there is large jump in retail sector by end of year , mostly in Nov and Dec.patterns also make us notice that there are 
unsual dips in retail sector around Jun ,July.Seasonal plot is similar to time plot except the data are plotted against the individual "seasons" in which data were observed.There can also be variation made in plot using polar co-ordinates.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
ggseasonplot(myts, polar = TRUE) +
  ylab("$ million") +
  ggtitle("Seasonal plot: Retail data")
```
        
                             

```{r,echo = TRUE}
ggsubseriesplot(myts) +
  ylab("$ million") +
  ggtitle("Seasonal subseries plot: antidiabetic drug sales")
```
                                   
                                      
Seasonality plot validates our clain that retail sector has maximum business in November and December each year.
The horizontal line indicates means for each month.This form of plot enables the underlaying seasonal pattern to be seen clearly,also showing changes in seasonality over time.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
gglagplot(myts)
```
                              
Figure shows Lagged scatterplots for monthly retail data.
The relations are strongly positive for month 5,6,7 i.e May,June,July for lag 1,2,3,4 and strongly negative for month 5 in lag 5,6,7.

```{r,echo = TRUE}

ggAcf(window(myts),start = 1982)
```
                            
                                 
Figure 6 shows Autocorrelation function for monthly retail data for Australia.
As we can observe there is no negative co-relation observed. The dashed blue lines indicate whether the correlations are significantly different from zero.

grid.arrange(a,b,c,d, nrow = 2)
```
                                
                                 
```{r,echo = TRUE}
a1 <- ggseasonplot(arrivals[,"Japan"]) + ylab("Thousand") +ggtitle("Seasonal plot:Arrivals data for Japan")
b1 <- ggseasonplot(arrivals[,"NZ"]) + ylab("Thousand") +ggtitle("Seasonal plot:Arrivals data for NZ")

d1 <- ggseasonplot(arrivals[,"US"]) + ylab("Thousand") +ggtitle("Seasonal plot:Arrivals data for US")
grid.arrange(a1,b1,c1,d1, nrow = 2)
```

                               
The most unusual observation is obsereved for arrival data in 'UK' for Q2 and Q3.The arrival numbers are drastically down but gradually increased in Q4.At the same time,
New zealand shows highest arrival rates for Q3.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
a2 <- ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[,"Japan"]) + ylab("Thousand") +ggtitle("Seasonal plot:Arrivals data for Japan")
b2 <- ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[,"NZ"]) + ylab("Thousand") +ggtitle("Seasonal plot:Arrivals data for NZ")
c2 <- ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[,"UK"]) + ylab("Thousand") +ggtitle("Seasonal plot:Arrivals data for UK")
d2 <- ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[,"US"]) + ylab("Thousand") +ggtitle("Seasonal plot:Arrivals data for US")
grid.arrange(a2,b2,c2,d2, nrow = 2) 
```
                                    
                                    

Seasonal subseries plot emphasises theseasonal patterns of data.The horizontal lines indicate means for each quarter.This form of plot enables the underlaying seasonal pattern to be seen clearly ,and also shows the changes in seasonality over time.If we observe seasonal plots for all four countries,New zealand has the highest rate of arrival data for all four quarters.UK seems to have lowest arrival rates for Q2 and Q3.

<div id="Question_05_HA3.8.PNG"><img src="Question_05_HA3.8.PNG" alt="Question_05_HA3.8.PNG"></div>
##### For your retail time series (from Exercise 3 in Section 2.10):

Loading the reatil data
```{r}
retaildata <- readxl::read_excel("retail.xlsx", skip=1)
myts <- ts(retaildata[,"A3349873A"],
  frequency=12, start=c(1982,4))
```
##### a) Split the data into two parts using

```{r }
myts.train <- window(myts, end=c(2010,12))
myts.test <- window(myts, start=2011)
```

##### b) Check that your data have been split appropriately by producing the following plot.

```{r}

autoplot(myts) + autolayer(myts.train, series="Training") +
  autolayer(myts.test, series="Test")
```

##### c) Calculate forecasts using snaive applied to myts.train.

```{r }
fc <- snaive(myts.train)
```

##### d) Compare the accuracy of your forecasts against the actual values stored in myts.test.

```{r }
accuracy(fc,myts.test)
```

##### e) Check the residuals.Do the residuals appear to be uncorrelated and normally distributed?

```{r }
checkresiduals(fc)
```

From the above it seems like residuals are correlated to each other.
Residuals are not normally distributed.

##### f) How sensitive are the accuracy measures to the training/test split?

```{r }
myts2.train <- window(myts, end=c(2011,12))
myts2.test <- window(myts, start=2012)
fc2 <- snaive(myts2.train)
accuracy(fc2,myts.test)
```
The accuracy measures are sensitive to the training/test split. Here we changed the train/test split percentage and run the accuracy check again and that reslts in low values in accuracy measure indicators. Comparing this to original matrix clearly indicates that the measures are sensitive to the split.

##### <span style="color:blue"><b><u>HA# 6.2</u></b></span>
<div id="Question_06_HA6.2.PNG"><img src="Question_06_HA6.2.PNG" alt="Question_06_HA6.2.PNG"></div>
##### a) Plot the time series of sales of product A. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend-cycle?

Loading the required libraries and plastics data
```{r }

plastics
ts(plastics)
plot(plastics,main = 'Plastic time plot')
```

From the above Time plot we can see there are seasonal fluctuations and upward trend.
Seasonal sales are peaking in summer.
Overall plot shows positive trnd with sales increasing yearly.


##### b) Use a classical multiplicative decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices.

```{r }
plastic_model <- decompose(plastics, type="multiplicative")
trend <- plastic_model$trend #calculating trend
trend
seasonal <- plastic_model$seasonal # calculating seasonal indices
seasonal

```


##### c) Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part a?

Yes, the results support the graphical interpretation.The graph indicates that the summer months have higher  seasonal indices than the winter months


##### d) Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data.

Here we are  showing the trend-cycle component and the seasonally adjusted data, along with the original data.

```{r }
autoplot(plastics, series="Data") +
  autolayer(trendcycle(plastic_model), series="Trend") +
  autolayer(seasadj(plastic_model), series="Seasonally Adjusted") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Monthly Sales in Thousands") +
  ggtitle("Plastic Sales") +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("gray","blue","red"), breaks=c("Data","Seasonally Adjusted","Trend"))
```

##### e) Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 500 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier?

Here we are adding 500 to 29th observation 
```{r }
outlier_plastic <- plastics
outlier_plastic[29] <- outlier_plastic[29] + 500
outlier_model <- decompose(outlier_plastic, type = "multiplicative")
```
Plot showing the trend-cycle component and the seasonally adjusted data, along with the original data with modified outlier data.

```{r }
autoplot(outlier_plastic, series = "Data") +
  autolayer(trendcycle(outlier_model), series = "Trend") +
  autolayer(seasadj(outlier_model), series = "Seasonally Adjusted") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Monthly Sales in Thousands") +
  ggtitle("Plastic Sales") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("gray", "blue", "red"), breaks=c("Data", "Seasonally Adjusted", "Trend"))
```

We can see from the above graph that outlier doesnot have much effects on Trend cycle but it is highly effecting the seasonal data

##### f) Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series?
Here we are adding 500 to 52nd observation 
```{r }
outlierend_plastic <- plastics
outlierend_plastic[52] <- outlierend_plastic[52] + 500
outlierend_model <- decompose(outlierend_plastic, type = "multiplicative")
```
Plot showing the trend-cycle component and the seasonally adjusted data, along with the original data with modified outlier data
```{r }
autoplot(outlierend_plastic, series = "Data") +
  autolayer(trendcycle(outlierend_model), series = "Trend") +
  autolayer(seasadj(outlierend_model), series = "Seasonally Adjusted") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Monthly Sales in Thousands") +
  ggtitle("Plastic Sales") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("gray", "blue", "red"), breaks=c("Data", "Seasonally Adjusted", "Trend"))
```
We can conclude that an outlier causes a spike in the month it is present by increasing seasonality index of that month.

##### <span style="color:blue"><b><u>HA# 6.6</u></b></span>
<div id="Question_07_HA6.6.PNG"><img src="Question_07_HA6.6.PNG" alt="Question_07_HA6.6.PNG"></div>
##### a) Use an STL decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices. (Experiment with having fixed or changing seasonality.)


```{r }
stl_brickfixed <- stl(bricksq, s.window = "periodic",robust = TRUE)
autoplot(stl_brickfixed) +ggtitle("Brick Data with fixed seasonality")
```


```{r }
stl_brickchange <- stl(bricksq,s.window = 5,robust = TRUE)
autoplot(stl_brickchange) +ggtitle("Brick Data with changing seasonality")
```


##### b) Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data.
Here we are  showing the trend-cycle component and the seasonally adjusted data, along with the original data.
```{r }
# plot data which are decomposed by STL with fixed seasonality
autoplot(bricksq, series = "Data") +
  autolayer(trendcycle(stl_brickfixed),
            series = "Trend-cycle") +
  autolayer(seasadj(stl_brickfixed),
            series = "Seasonally Adjusted Data") +
  ggtitle("brick production fixed seasonality") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red", "blue"),
                     breaks = c("Data", "Trend-cycle", "Seasonally Adjusted Data"))
# plot data which are decomposed by STL with changing seasonality
autoplot(bricksq, series = "Data") +
  autolayer(trendcycle(stl_brickchange),
            series = "Trend-cycle") +
  autolayer(seasadj(stl_brickchange),
            series = "Seasonally Adjusted Data") +
  ggtitle("brick production changing seasonality") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red", "blue"),
                     breaks = c("Data", "Trend-cycle", "Seasonally Adjusted Data"))

```


##### c) Use a naïve method to produce forecasts of the seasonally adjusted data.
```{r }
stl_brickfixed %>% seasadj() %>% naive() %>% autoplot() + 
  ggtitle(label = "Naive forecast of fixed seasonal brick data")
stl_brickchange %>% seasadj() %>% naive() %>% autoplot() + 
  ggtitle(label = "Naive forecast of change seasonal adjusted brick data")
```
From the above we can see that the prediction intervals of seasonally adjusted data decomposed by STL with changing seasonality have smaller range than the one with fixed seasonality. It happened because the variance of the remainder component decreased when the seasonality can be changed.


##### d) Use stlf() to reseasonalise the results, giving forecasts for the original data.

```{r}
fcast <- stlf(bricksq, method='naive')
autoplot(fcast)
```



##### e) Do the residuals look uncorrelated?

```{r}
checkresiduals(fcast)


```
The residuals are correlated with each other.


##### f) Repeat with a robust STL decomposition. Does it make much difference?


```{r}
stlf_brickrobust <- stlf(bricksq, robust = TRUE)
autoplot(stlf_brickrobust)
checkresiduals(stlf_brickrobust)
```
It looked like the autocorrelations became lower generally, but there are still some high values left.


##### g) Compare forecasts from stlf() with those from snaive(), using a test set comprising the last 2 years of data. Which is better?
 
Splitting data into test and train data set and then applying stlf and snaive on the train data.
```{r}
#subsetting train data set leaving last 2 years
train_brick <- subset(bricksq, 
                        end = length(bricksq) - 8)
#subsetting test data set including only last 2 years data
test_brick <- subset(bricksq,
                        start = length(bricksq) - 7)

snaive_bricksq_train <- snaive(train_brick)

stlf_bricksq_train <- stlf(train_brick, robust = TRUE)
# plot data and forecast results
autoplot(bricksq, series = "Original data") +
  autolayer(stlf_bricksq_train, PI = FALSE, size = 1,
            series = "stlf") +
  autolayer(snaive_bricksq_train, PI = FALSE, size = 1,
            series = "snaive") +
   scale_color_manual(values = c("gray50", "blue", "red"),
                     breaks = c("Original data", "stlf", "snaive")) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1990, 1994.5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(300, 600)) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Data")) +
  ggtitle("Forecast from stlf and snaive functions") 
  
accuracy(snaive_bricksq_train,test_brick)
accuracy(stlf_bricksq_train,test_brick)

```

From the above forescast plot we can see that the forecasts from stlf function are more similar to the original data than the forecasts from snaive function.stlf function can also use trend, and its seasonality can change over time. The test set have trend with seasonality.Sometimes, different accuracy measures will lead to different results as to which forecast method is best. However, in this case, all of the results point to the stlf method as the best method for this data set.
